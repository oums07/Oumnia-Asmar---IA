    """Generate a random valid path from the start to the goal.

    This function is provided only to demonstrate the path visualization.
    It is not a search algorithm and is not guaranteed to return a shortest
    path.

    At each step, the trainer randomly chooses one valid neighboring state.
    Unvisited neighbors are preferred, but previously visited states may be
    selected when necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    game_map : list[list[str]]
        The Pokémon map.
    start : tuple[int, int]
        Initial trainer position.
    goal : tuple[int, int]
        Pokémon Center position.
    seed : int or None, default=None
        Random seed used to make the generated path reproducible.
    max_steps : int, default=1000
        Maximum number of movements in one attempt.
    max_attempts : int, default=100
        Maximum number of random walks attempted.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[int, int]]
        A valid path beginning at ``start`` and ending at ``goal``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If no random path reaches the goal within the allowed attempts.
